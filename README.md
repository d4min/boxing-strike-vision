# Boxing Strike Vision

A computer vision system that monitors and analyses boxing punches in real-time using a standard webcam.

## Project Overview

Boxing Strike Vision uses computer vision and pose estimation to track and evaluate boxing techniques. The system analyses a person throwing punches parallel to a webcam and provides real-time feedback on punch type, speed, and form.

## Project Goals

    1. Accessibility: Create a tool that allows boxers to analyse their technique without expensive equipment
    1. Real-time Feedback: Provide immediate visual feedback on punch execution
    1. Simplicity: Focus on an intuitive interface that doesn't interfere with training
